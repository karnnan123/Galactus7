 [Galatus] üéØ



 Team Name: [Code Buddies]


Team Members

 Project Description
[Galatus is a fun, fast-paced game where you face waves of guards, level up, and eventually face the Boss Level with only a 10% chance of survival.]

 The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[In a world full of games that actually make sense, there was a tragic lack of pixelated chaos where guards endlessly chase you for no reason. People were sleeping peacefully, and we decided to ruin that.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We proudly present Galatus ‚Äî a game where we give you exactly what you didn‚Äôt know you didn‚Äôt need: a thrilling escape from absolutely nothing important. Oh, and the boss? Yeah, you‚Äôll probably lose.
